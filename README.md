## Overview of Analysis
As a starting point for our analysis, we utilized data from Citi Bike for New York City from August 2019.

Per your request, we utilized the August 2019 Citi Bike data to create analysis for bike trips. 

In addition to the bike trip analysis requested for your review, we have also included some of our initial analysis for your consideration.

## Results
### Checkout Times for Users
First, we reviewed the data for the actual duration of trip to determine the length of time users kept the bikes. For the total trips of 2,344,224, the highest number of rides occured at the 5 hour trip duration mark. Trip durations 10 hours or less are more popular (1,444,876) than trip durations 11 hours or more (899,348). 

### Checkout Times by Hours, Minutes
Next, we utilized the same criteria: trip duration and number of bikes. However, we drilled down into each hour to get the trip durations by hours and minutes if you wanted a more detailed look.

### Checkout Times by Gender
We took the same criteria: trip duration and number of bikes as in the previous example but we also included gender to identify which gender currently utilizes Citi Bikes more. We also included the unknown category as well. 

### Trip by Weekday by Hour
Next, we utilized a heatmap to show the popular days and times of day to rent a bike. On Saturday and Sunday, the most popular times are during the day. Saturday is more popular than Sunday and starts earlier. During the work week, the popular times occur before 9 am and pick up again around 5 pm.  

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour )
For our next trip analysis, we kept the weekdays and hours as the previous analysis to separate out the results by gender. Males again are the more likely to utilize Citi Bike. The periods of time were consistent with the previous analysis.

### User Trips by Gender (Weekday)
Next, we reviewed the weekdays, gender and type of user (customer vs subscriber). Unknown subscribers were the smallest group. Male subscribers were the largest group with heavy use on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Overall Wednesday appears to be the slowest day among all users. 

### Gender Breakdown
We included a pie chart with the gender breakdown for the recorded trips in August 2019. Males represented 1,530,272 of the users. Females represented 225,521 of the users. Unknown gender accounted for 588,431 of the rides. We'd suggest expanding the options for inclusivity and more useful data.

### August Peak Hours	
We reviewed the start time of all rides. The most popular times are 5 pm, 6 pm and 8 am. Slowest times were 4 am, 3 am and 2 am. 

## Summary
While comparing New York City and Des Moines is like comparing an apple to an orange, analyzing the data hopefully has prompted a lot of questions and things to explore for rolling out a similar business in Des Moines. Are there opportunities to provide bikes for tourists when they come to visit and would like the experience of a bike ride to explore areas and neighborhoods over a rental car or public transportation. Is it worthwhile to provide bikes in Des Moines as an alternative to public transportation? Are there areas to increase bike use among females? Or increase use during different parts of the day? 

Other areas to explore include lower rate of use among females. Are the bikes too large, not in popular locations, would adding a basket increase bike use overall? 

Would adjusting the cost of bike rental increase use? Would offering discounts during off-peak hours make rental more desirable? 

What is the most common reason people use the bike for less than an hour? To run errands, to avoid public transportation? Could the use of bikes be marketed for running errands, cost savings over public transportation, benefit of exercise etc be utilized? Should more bikes be placed close to bus stops, train stops etc?
